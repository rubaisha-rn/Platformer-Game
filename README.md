# Platformer-Game
This video showcases a single-stage browser-based platformer game developed using JavaScript as part of the Introduction to Programming I course at the University of London.

The game features:
⦁	A character with three lives attempting to complete the stage
⦁	Obstacles including canyons and animated enemies
⦁	Custom-designed visuals inspired by The Powerpuff Girls
⦁	Integrated background music and sound effects to enhance the player experience

This project demonstrates creative design blended with foundational programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, collision detection, and user interaction in a fully coded JavaScript environment.

Note: Code is currently withheld for academic integrity purposes. It will be uploaded after graduation.
